A Positive Operator Valued Measure is a generalization of [[Projective Measurements]].
A POVM is described by a set of matrices  $M=(M_k)_{k=1}$ where each $M_k$ is a positive operator in $L(\mathcal{H})$ and and $\sum_{k=1} M_k = \mathbb{1}$. Here, $L(\mathcal{H})$ are all linear operators on the [[Hilbert Space]] $\mathcal{H}$.
