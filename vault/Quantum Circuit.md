A *quantum circuit*  generalizes the idea of classical [[Circuit Family|Circuit Families]] by replacing the [[Logic Gates]] AND, OR, and NOT by elementary, unitary quantum gates. 
A quantum gate is a [[Unitary Matrix|unitary]] transformation on a small (usually 1, 2, or 3) number of qubits.

Elementary quantum gates can be composed into bigger unitary operations by taking tensor products (if gates are applied in parallel to different parts of the register), and ordinary matrix products (if gates are applied sequentially).
