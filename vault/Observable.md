A [[Projective Measurements|projective measurement]] with $m$ projectors $P_1, \dots, P_m$ and associated distinct outcomes $\lambda_1,\dots , \lambda_n \in \mathbb{R}$, can be written as one matrix $M =\sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i P_i$, which is called an observable.

Since $M$ is built out of projectors and real numbers, it is a [[Hermitian Matrix]]. Every observable is a Hermitian matrix. 
Since every Hermitian matrix allows for a [[Spectral Decomposition|spectral decomposition]] of the form $M =\sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i P_i$, also every Hermitian matrix can be interpreted as an observable.

## Example 
Taking up the example from the [[Projective Measurements]], we can write the observable related to the [[Computational Basis]]
$$Z=\ket{0}\bra{0}-\ket{1}\bra{1}.$$
The prefactors are $\lambda_0=1$ and $\lambda_1=-1$.
