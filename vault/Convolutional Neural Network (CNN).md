  
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized type of neural network designed for tasks involving visual data, such as images. They are characterized by their unique architecture, which includes:

1. Convolutional Layers: These layers use convolution operations to automatically detect and capture patterns, features, and structures within the input data. Convolutional filters, also known as kernels, slide over the input, creating feature maps that highlight relevant information.
    
2. Pooling Layers: Pooling layers downsample the feature maps, reducing the spatial dimensions of the data. This helps in reducing computation and makes the network more robust to variations in scale and orientation.
    
3. Fully Connected Layers: After several convolutional and pooling layers, CNNs typically include one or more fully connected layers to make high-level decisions based on the extracted features.
    
CNNs excel in tasks that involve spatial relationships, making them particularly adept at tasks like image classification. However, their versatility extends beyond the visual domain, as they have also been successfully applied in the study of quantum systems. (see references)
