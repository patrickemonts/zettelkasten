A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes, organized into layers. These nodes work together to process and learn from data, enabling the network to recognize patterns, make predictions, and solve tasks. Neural networks have found applications in various fields, including image recognition, natural language processing, and even physics.
