A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes, organized into layers, which emulate the neural structure. These nodes apply an activation function to the weighted sum of their inputs, introducing non-linearity to the model.  The weights in a neural network are adaptable parameters that the model adapts during training, influencing the strength of connections between neurons. This combination of weighted connections and activation functions allows neural networks to model complex, non-linear relationships in data. Consequently, they are a powerful tool which has found application in various fields including image recognition, natural language processing, and even physics.
