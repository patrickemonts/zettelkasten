German term (loosely meaning approach, attempt, onset of work) describing an educated guess taken in order to attempt the solution of a problem.
An ansatz is a trial solution, typically with some free parameter that can be tuned to get closer to the correct solution.
In this course we mostly use it as short for *ansatz state*, a parametrized quantum state $\ket{\psi(\theta)}$ which might admit a classical description (e.g. [[Matrix Product States (MPS)]], [[Slater Determinant]], [[Product State]]), or might need to be prepared on a quantum register using a [[Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC)]].
The educated guess is here in the form of $\ket{\psi(\theta)}$: the way we construct the PQC defines which states we can possibly get from it.
