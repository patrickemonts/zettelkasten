Given a Hamiltonian, the problem of finding its lowest eigenvalue (ground state energy). 
In an extended sense, also the problem of finding a description of that ground state, or preparing the ground state on a quantum register, so that other properties besides its energy can be studied. 
A certain (very general) promise-based formulation of the ground state problem is known to be [[QMA]]-hard.
