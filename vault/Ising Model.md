The (classial) Ising model is a model for magnetism. Its Hamiltonian is given by
$$ H= J\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle} \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_j,$$
where $\sigma_i^z$ is the $z$ [[Pauli Matrices|Pauli matrix]], $J$ is the coupling constant and the sum runs over nearest neighbors. For $J>0$ the model describes anti-ferromagnetism, for $J<0$ the ferromagnetic.


## 1 space dimension (line)
The system does *not* undergo a phase transition.
## 2 space dimensions (square lattice)
The ferromagnetic system undergoes a phase transition from an ordered to a disordered phase at finite temperature.
The critical temperature is
$$\frac{kT_c}{J}=\frac{2}{\ln(1+\sqrt{2})}\approx 2.26918531421$$
