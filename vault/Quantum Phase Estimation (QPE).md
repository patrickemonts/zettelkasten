A family of quantum algorithms that aim to infer one or more eigenvalues $e^{i \phi}$ of a unitary operator $U$, by applying controlled $U^k$ operations, obtaining a signal due to interference on the control register, and processing this signal with either a quantum algorithm (e.g. [[Quantum Fourier Transform]]) or a classical algorithm (e.g. signal processing in single-ancilla QPE).
