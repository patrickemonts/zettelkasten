Adiabatic State Preparation is an early quantum simulation algorithm for finding ground states, which relies on the adiabatic theorem. 
The key concept is simulating a slow evolution under a time dependent Hamiltonian, $H(t) = (1-t) H_0 + t H_1$, starting from the (known) ground state of the initial Hamiltonian $H_0$. Under non-degeneracy conditions and if the evolution is slow enough, at $t=1$ we obtain the ground state of the target Hamiltonian $H_1$.
