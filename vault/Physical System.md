Mathematically, an isolated physical quantum system is defined by two objects: 
  -  a [[Hilbert Space|Hilbert space]] $\mathcal{H}$ on which the systems state can be defined, and
  - a [[Hamiltonian]] $H$ which defines how the system state will evolve in time (dynamics).

 Extensions can be made for systems which interact with their environment (e.g. time-dependent Hamiltonian, or [[open quantum system]] dynamics like [[Lindblad Equation|Lindblad equation]]).
