Spin liquids are a broad range of phases of matter that often support exotic physics such as [[Quasiparticles | quasiparticle]] excitations and [[Emergence | emergent]] symmetries. They are mostly characterized by what they are not, namely ordered: down to very low temperature, typically, no order parameter develops. There are notions of [[Classical spin liquids |classical spin liquids]] - where the spin degree-of-freedom is described by a vector or a number - and [[Quantum spin liquids |quantum spin liquids]] - where the properties of the material rely on the fact that the spin is described by non-commuting operators.
