The time-independent Schrödinger Equation is given by 
$$H\ket{\psi}=E\ket{\psi},$$
where $H$ is the [[Hamiltonian]], a hermitian matrix and $E$ is a scalar. This is a formulation of an [[Eigenvalue Problem]]. the [[Hamiltonian]] is given, and the goal is to find a state $\ket{\psi}$ and an energy $E$ such that the equation is fulfilled.
