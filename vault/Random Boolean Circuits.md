*Random Boolean Circuits* receive in addition to the $n$ input bits, also some random bits (“coin flips”) as input. 

A randomized circuit computes a function $f$ if it successfully outputs the right answer $f(x)$ with probability at least $2/3$ for every value of $x$.
The probability is taken over the values of the random bits.
