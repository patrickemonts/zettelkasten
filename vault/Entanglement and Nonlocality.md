Entanglement and nonlocality are intimately related.

Quantum states which violate a Bell inequality are necessarily entangled. Thus, **nonlocality implies [[Entanglement|entanglement]].**
In other words, these quantum states are not separable and cannot be represented as mixtures of projections onto product states

**For pure states, entanglement also implies nonlocality.**
Any entangled pure state of two parties violates the [[CHSH inequality]] (Gisin). The result was later extended to an arbitrary number of parties (Popescu and Rohlich).

**For mixed states, entanglement does NOT imply nonlocality.**
Werner constructed examples of mixed bipartite *entangled* states that admit a LHV model for all local projective measurements. 
Barrett generalized the result to arbitrary measurements.

More generally, entanglement and nonlocality are inequivalent for any number of parties, i.e, that there exist genuinely multipartite entangled states that do not display genuinely multipartite nonlocality (Augusiak et al.).

As a result: **entanglement is a weaker property of quantum states than nonlocality.**
