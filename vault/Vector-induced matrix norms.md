#norms #matrix 

A matrix norm is induced by vector norms, as
$$
\Vert M \Vert_{\alpha, \beta} = \sup\left\{\Vert M\ x\Vert_\beta,\, {\rm with}\, \Vert x \Vert_\alpha = 1 \right\}
$$
In case there is only one index
$$
\Vert M \Vert_p = \sup_{x \neq 0} \frac{\Vert M \ x\Vert_p}{\Vert x\Vert_p}
$$

Note that in some cases the notation for $\Vert M \Vert_p$ is the same as in the case of [[Schatten norms]].
