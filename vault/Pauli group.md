The single-qubit Pauli group is defined as 
$$
\mathcal P = \{ \pm I , \pm i I, \pm X , \pm i X, \pm Y , \pm i Y, \pm Z , \pm i Z\}
$$

The $n$-qubit Pauli group is defined as 
$$
\mathcal P_n = \{ \pm 1, \pm i\} \cdot \{I, X, Y, Z\}^{\otimes n}.
$$
Here, $X, Y, Z$ are the three single-qubit Pauli operators and $I$ is the single-qubit identity operator.
