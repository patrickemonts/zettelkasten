[[Random Boolean Circuits]] are equal in power to randomized Turing machines: a language $L$ can be decided by a uniformly polynomial randomized circuit family if and only if $L ∈ \textbf{BPP}$, where $\textbf{BPP}$ (*“Bounded-error Probabilistic Polynomial time”)* is the class of languages that can efficiently be recognized by randomized Turing machines with success probability at least $2/3$.

The value of $2/3$ is arbitrary since there are efficient ways to reduce the error probability of randomized algorithms. The constant can be fixed to anything in the open interval $c\in(0.5, 1)$, i.e. $0.5<c<1$.
