Entanglement refer to quantum correlations between different qubits. 
If we consider two qubits in the state
$$
\ket{\psi}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{00}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ket{11},
$$
the state is *entangled*. Sometimes, this state is called an *EPR-pair* or [[Bell state]].

Initially neither of the two qubits has a classical value $0$ or $1$.  If we measure the first [[Qubit|qubit]] and observe, say, a $\ket{0}$, then the whole state collapses to $\ket{00}$.
Thus observing the first qubit immediately fixes also the value of the second qubit.
This argument does not rely on the distance of the qubits. It exhibits the non-local behaviour of quantum mechanics.

In general, a bipartite state  is called *separable* if it can be written as a tensor product $\ket{\phi_A}\otimes\ket{\phi_B}$ where $\ket{\phi_A}$ lives in the first space and $\ket{\phi_B}$ lives in the second. 
A state that is **not** separable is called *entangled*.
