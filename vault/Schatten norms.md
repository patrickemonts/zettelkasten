A Schatten matrix norm is defined as
$$
\Vert M \Vert_{\alpha, \beta} = \sup\left\{\Vert M\ x\Vert_\beta,\, {\rm with}\, \Vert x \Vert_\alpha = 1 \right\}
$$
In case there is only one index
$$
\Vert M \Vert_p = \left( \sum_{i = 1}^{\min(m, n)} \sigma_i^p(M)\right)^{1/p},
$$
where $\sigma_i(M)$ is the $i$-th singular value of the matrix $M$.
