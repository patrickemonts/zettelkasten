Any stabilizer circuit (see [[Stabilizer circuits]]) can be simulated efficiently by a classical computer following the stabilizer formalism. The key is to update the (generators of) the stabilizer group (see [[Stabilizer group]]) of the quantum state according to the rules imposed by Clifford gates, from the [[Clifford group]]. In the vanilla stabilizer formalism, this works only if the initial state is a stabilizer state ([[Stabilizer states]]). Also see [[Stabilizer circuits]].

For the generalization to general circuits, see [[Extended stabilizer formalism]].
