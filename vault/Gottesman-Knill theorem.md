#simulation #stabilizer

Any quantum computation composed only by Clifford gates can be simulated efficiently by a classical computer following the stabilizer formalism. The key is to update Pauli operators according to the rules imposed by Clifford gates, from the [[Clifford group]]. This works only if the initial state is stabilized by a collection of Pauli strings.
