Emergence is a broad concept in physics and more specifically in condensed matter theory. It corresponds to the idea idea that looking at collective behavior of many degrees-of-freedom can lead to an elegant and useful simplification of the original problem. 

# Examples
A few key examples of what is meant by emergence
- Excitations above a complex ground state, which might behave in much simpler ways than the ground state they arise from ([[Quasiparticles | Quasiparticles]])
- Renormalization from a discrete to a higher (typically continuous) symmetry, for instance going from lattice symmetries to U(1) symmetry [2]
