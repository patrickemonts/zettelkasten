A *directed graph* is an ordered pair _G_ = (_V_, _A_) where

- $V$ is a set of vertices;
- $E$ is a set of *ordered* pairs of vertices, _directed edges_.

The edge set $E$ differs from an ordinary or undirected graph, in that the latter is defined in terms of *unordered* pairs of vertices.
The edge set of a directed graph usually follows the convention $e\in E=(v_o,v_t)$, where $v_o$ is the origin vertex and $v_t$ is the target vertex. The directed edge $e$ is commonly illustrated by an arrow pointing from $v_o$ to $v_e$.
