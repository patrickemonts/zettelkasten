Tensor Networks are a structured ansatz for wave functions that consists of tensors and connections between them. The structure of the ansatz influences expressibilty and computational efficiency.
Usually, the ansatz is formulated in a [[Graphical Notation Tensor Networks | graphical notation]].
Common examples are matrix product states ([[MPS]]) and Projected Entangled Pair States ([[PEPS]]).
