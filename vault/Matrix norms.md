Matrix norms are useful quantities to characterize matrices. The particular norm used might have strong influence in the results available for theoretical works. Matrix norms are invariants, that is insensitive to unitary operations
$$
\Vert M \Vert = \Vert U M U^\dagger \Vert
$$

A matrix norm is induced by vector norms, as
$$
\Vert M \Vert_{\alpha, \beta} = \sup\left\{\Vert M\ x\Vert_\beta,\, {\rm with}\, \Vert x \Vert_\alpha = 1 \right\}
$$
In case there is only one index
$$
\Vert M \Vert_p = \sup_{x \neq 0} \frac{\Vert M \ x\Vert_p}{\Vert x\Vert_p}
$$
Some examples of norms are absolute values of traces, or eigenvalues. See linked documents for more information.
