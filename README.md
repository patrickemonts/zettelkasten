# Zettelkasten

The German word Zettelkasten literally translates to "box of notes".
The idea is to build an interconnected database of notes that serves as a knowledge base.
The concept is rather old already (check ![here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)). An especially famous example of a Zettelkasten is the collection by the sociologist ![Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann).

# Concept
A Zettelkasten is a collection of short notes that explain concepts. This Zettelkasten is focused on, but not strictly limited to, quantum physiscs and adjacent fields.

## Major rules of the Zettelkasten
In order to make this repository as useful as possible to many people, please adhere to the following rules:

1. Keep notes short.
2. Keep notes simple.  
If the concept needs more explanation, consider splitting it in multiple (linked) notes.
The idea of a note is not to show that you know, but to explain it to others.
3. Be precise. 
4. Add references to relevant paper or reviews.
5. Use tags.
Add tags to your notes to add them to larger groups. If you add new tags, make sure that there is no almost identical tag.
6. Link notes.  
A Zettelkasten only works if notes are linked together such that other people may find them.
7. Reiterate over notes and correct them.  
As areas in the Zettelkasten grow, it might be worth to reorganize notes. This might result in splitting notes up, merging notes or creating summary notes to make other notes easier to reach.

# Tools
This Zettelkasten is based on ![Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and ![git](https://www.git-scm.com).
Obisidan displays markdown notes, manages links between the notes and the tag network. 
It is the main tool to edit, add and manage notes.

We use git to synchronize the notes via github. 
It helps to track changes and make sure that involuntary edits do not propagate to others.
